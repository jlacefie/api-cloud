# Temporal cloud api proto files

## How to use

Copy over the protobuf files under [temporal](temporal) directory to the project directory and then use [grpc](https://grpc.io/docs/) to compile and generate code in the desired programming language.

## URL

The grpc URL the clients should connect to:
```
saas-api.tmprl.cloud:443
```

## Samples

Refer [cloud-samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/cloud-samples-go) repository for demonstration on how a project can copy and build Go clients.
